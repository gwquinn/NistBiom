NistBiom
=============

An [R](http://r-project.org/) package to display and analyze ROC curves.

This package is still heavily in development. The eventual goal is to improve transparancy with respect to how NIST assesses accuracy in some of its biometric evaluations. The code does not reflect how performance was assessed in past biometric evalutions. Once this code reaches a certain maturity level it will likely be transferred to the usnistgov group on GitHub (https://github.com/usnistgov).
